# Training Notifications Enhancement

## Overview

Enhanced the training experience with automatic completion notifications and real-time status updates.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Training Completion Toasts

- **Training Completed**: Green success toast when training finishes successfully
- **Training Failed**: Red destructive toast with error details when training fails
- **Training Cancelled**: Orange warning toast when training is cancelled

### 2. Automatic Status Detection

- Uses React Query polling to check training status every 5 seconds
- Detects status transitions from "processing" to final states
- Shows appropriate toast notifications based on status changes

### 3. UI Auto-refresh

- Automatically invalidates and refreshes related queries when training completes
- Updates agent data to show new `trained_on` timestamp
- Refreshes training status component without page reload

### 4. Smart Training Status Display

- Only shows TrainingStatus component when training has started (not for "not_started" status)
- Provides clear visual feedback for all training states
- Handles error states with detailed error messages

## Technical Implementation

### Constants Updated

- Added new success messages for training completion states
- Centralized messaging for consistency

### Hook Enhancements

- Enhanced `useTrainingStatus` with status change detection
- Added useRef to track previous status for comparison
- Integrated automatic query invalidation on completion

### Component Improvements

- Updated TrainingStatus component for better state handling
- Improved SourcesSummary logic for training status visibility
- Added proper error handling and loading states

## User Experience Flow

1. **Training Start**:

   - User clicks "Train Agent" button
   - Toast shows "Agent training started successfully"
   - Button shows loading state with "Training..." text

2. **Training Progress**:

   - TrainingStatus component appears showing current status
   - Automatic polling updates status every 5 seconds
   - Progress indicators show training is in progress

3. **Training Completion**:
   - Automatic detection of status change
   - Toast notification shows completion status
   - UI refreshes to show updated agent information
   - Training status component updates to show completion

## Benefits

- **No Manual Refresh**: Users don't need to reload the page
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate notifications when training completes
- **Error Awareness**: Clear error messages when training fails
- **Consistent UX**: Follows established toast notification patterns
- **Efficient Polling**: Smart polling that stops when training completes

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test training completion flow with successful training
2. Test error handling with failed training scenarios
3. Verify polling stops after completion
4. Check UI refresh behavior
5. Test cancellation scenarios

The enhancement provides a seamless, user-friendly training experience with proper feedback mechanisms and automatic status updates.
